# Project 6 - BeReal Clone Pt. 2

Submitted by: Samyutha Potharaju

BeReal Clone Pt.2 is an app that allows users to persist login, blurs photos on feed before posting, and lets users upload their own photos

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can launch camera to take photo instead of photo library (OR user uploads unique photo from photo album)
- [x] User session persists when application is closed and relaunched
- [x] Users are able to log out and return to sign in page
- [x] Users are NOT able to see other photos until they upload their own	
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User receive notifcation when it is time to post
- [ ] Users can make comments and view comments in posts	

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
I can improve the app by allowing users to add friends and view only their friends posts.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I encountered were configuring the blur view so that it is on the image only and not on the entire view.
